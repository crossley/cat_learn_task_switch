Neural signature of hierarchically structured expectations
predicts clustering and transfer of rule sets in
reinforcement learning

NOTE: In general, again, wonderful writing.

NOTE: In general, so far at least, the Collins work does
indeed look at learning while task switching, but the
learning is absolutely trivial compared to our task.

Haven't read this one yet I don' think.

haven't read this one yet either.

NOTE: These are likely the most important papers so far.

Nice but familiar by this stage.

The other 2016 paper showed that motor factors influence the
heiarchry. This paper seems to be showing simply that people
can find something like the optimal hierarchy.

Okay.

Gotta be techniques here to use with our stuff.

May need to go read that earlier work first... or maybe just
tired.


NOTE: Good modeling stuff will come back to when fresh
