Great example.

Again, very clear framing.

Great framing and motivation for the motor cat stuff I am
thinking about for next batch of honours. E.g., Dyno cues
could be amazing facilitators of task switching in II tasks
etc.

I wonder if there are some RB x II verbal report insights to
be gleened here.

NOTE: side note all of the questions / ideas posed in this
paper could reveal some very interesting automaticity
related research projects.

NOTE:: Highly relevant to our work.

TODO: Be sure Hannah sees this. It seems like it's a
plausible source of predictions / explanation / discussion
for whatever results she gets.

My gut is that this will basically be an applicatino of
their earlier modelling work to these studies but keep an
eye on it.

Yep.

Similar reasoning may predict that II learning (but not RB
learning?) should be best when using maximally separated
effectors.

NOTE: Key take away for me --- very relevant for Hannah but
not so much for switchtodd.
